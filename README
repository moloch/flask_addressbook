Installation instructions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Linux(Debian based distros):
--------------

If you don't have python 2.7 and pip installed, consider to launch these commands:

sudo apt-get install python2.7
sudo apt-get install python-pip

With pip, install all the other requirements listed in the Requirements section
of this document, using the command:

sudo pip install library_name

or, if you want to be sure to install the exact version, to avoid possible conflicts:

sudo pip install library_name==version

If you have problems or conflicts with other versions of the same libraries in your system,
you should consider to use virtualenv.
You can install virtualenv with the following command:

sudo apt-get install virtualenv

After installation, you should activate virtualenv from your application folder:

cd ~/path_to_addressbook
virtualenv venv --distribute
source venv/bin/activate

And then you can safely install all the requirements with pip:

sudo pip install library_name==version

Other Operating systems:
--------------

You can basically follow the debian instructions, but you have to install:
-python2.7
-python-pip
-python-virtualenv

from the binaries provided for your system.
Then you should be able to install other dependencies with pip.
